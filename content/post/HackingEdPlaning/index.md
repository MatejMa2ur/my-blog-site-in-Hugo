# Hacking EdPlanning

## Hello friend

During the weekend from 29th to 31st January I attended the 48 online hackathon Hacking EdPlanning, organised by UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning. This hackathon initiated 112 people from 12 countries, who helped with challenges to plan a brighter educational future.

#### This was my first international Hackathon. 
I get the information about this hackathon from teacher at my school. I wrote him e-mail that I am interested and same thing did 4 other students and he registered us. We used Slack to agree on what challenge we will be working. There came some little issues with communication and all of us had a lot of things to do and personally I forgot that any hackathon will be. Thankfully to my calendar which sent me notification I didn't missed it. Opening ceremony was at Zoom but after the explanation of the challenges from the organizers we moved to the Discord where all the communication took a place.

##### 29th january
Cause of the bad communication with my original team I responded to message from Alex and he was thankful that I wanted to join them. Firstly, the Lisbonne team were group of 5 people but because of some random things that happened only 3 remained and I was the only one amongst them who know how to display data. All of us were beginners in data science but the other 3 guys (Alex, Cl√©ment, √âtienne) were more interested in getting the data and better understanding the data.

After 20 minutes of talking what each of us can do, we started to create product which we will show at the end. The data sources were from Irish primary schools about them and also reports from the inspections. I immediately created a map visual with all schools and I found that one of them lays in the ocean. I was first one that saw the mistake even that information about the schools was from 2013. 

After few hours at 22:00 my clock rang. Normally at school I stop working and I prepare to go to sleep to have at least 8 hours of sleep. But hackathon challenge was waiting on me so I continued to work until 1:00 next morning. I was focused on creating example, how we can display the specific data. I was too tired to work so I have shown the √âtienne what I have created sent him the link and I went to sleep.

##### 30th January

The day started with breakfast. For most of us that is normal but this was online breakfast where we joined and between eating, we were talking. After that we have joined small standup where all teams presented what they have done and they want to proceed.

I didn't understand all teams because some of them presented in French. But after this opening of the day, we had enough will to continue. I added the info and help pages what you can find on each page to make the report easier to use.

During the day we have filled some forms about our Team like what funny thing did team encounter and we also created a team photo. Also everyone likes music and as 112 coders each of us has different taste for music. I found out about artist Glitch Mob and i shared Northern music groups - Wardruna, Heilung, Sk√°ld, Aurora.

Before the lunch we discussed what we can do with the data. √âtiene presented us a short presentation: How to analyze text. I have learned that the best way to work with text is to clean it from stop words that are words that don't have impact on the meaning of the content like (a, an, the, or, when,...). After cleaning, we transform the data into numbers with mathematical equation. After this each word is represented with value. Than these values can be used to create topics for group of words.

After the lunch we met again and agreed on what will each of us do. I continued on adding more content and making the Power BI easier to read. I added things like table which will show when you click on "hamburger" icon on the second site. Also I learned from internet how to add the card which will show when you hover over the specific data in my case, when you hover over the maps, you will see the preview of the data on the next page.

We also met one last time before the night at 21:00 and everyone presented what we did. After it was on each of us on what we will continue, but the next day was the presenting so I decided to add information and help pages as a easy guide what is located on the page. Same as the last day I went to sleep at 1:00 next morning.

#### 31st January

This day the morning routine was same the breakfast and the stand-up. Alex was working really long on the topics for words so we could display them on the report. This created the word cloud and the topic with we can group and filter the data. √âtiene was working on another table and representing words as values. Sadly Cl√©ment felt sick so he couldn't continue in his work, but his work was also helpful at 14:00 I get all the data that should have been displayed. The final event with presentation started around 16:30 so I had a plenty of time to change the sample data with the final. Alex was making fun of me because I said that it would be like 20 minutes to add them but after 2 minutes I unmuted myself and told them that it is done. 

Only one last thing we needed to be done and it was presentation. Because of a lot of teams the video presentation mustn't have been longer than 2 minute. We agreed that it would be best if only one of us would present sou we chose Alex and he did a great job.

It was 16:30 and the final ceremony started on Zoom. All of us connected and waited until we were first in the line. All of the project were really good, it was awesome to watch how many good projects were created even that we had only 48hours to work on them.

When we came on turn one of the organizers played our video, and after that all of the viewers could ask the questions not only referees. I didn't fully understand the questions for us but thankfully others have understood them. I think we did really good job.

And I think that now you are waiting for results. üòâ
Sadly we didn't get any price, but for me the weekend was really helpful, and also a way to improve my English. Thank you all who participated and made this event real. I hope next year we will meet again and create something helpful.
