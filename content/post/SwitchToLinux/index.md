## My starting system
From my young age, i had only experience with Windows computers. The oldest system i used was Windows 98. And then the legendary Windows XP.  
I never tought that sometimes i would be using different system than Windows. But at high school i came to conclusion after few painful BsoD (Blue screen of death). Which destroyed my work i was 100% i need a change.

## Choosing new OS
When you are choosing you have 3 options for OS:
* Linux
* Windows
* UNIX  

### UNIX
You can get any of for free nowadays, but the most popular UNIX os the Mac OS is paid and only in Apple devices, so if you don't want to spend additional money on new device, than maybe you should consider different OS. I could still choose OS like FreeBSD or OpenBSD, but i heard it is not system for begginers with UNIX. That's why i was left with a Linux.  

### Linux
I had only little experience with Linux so i had no idea which Distro i want to install. 
My friends which were daily driving Linux were using Ubuntu, Manjaro, Fedora.
And they recomended me Ubuntu or Manjaro.
I wasn't sure which one so i went on a hunt whiich one i want to use as my daily
driver. After checking lot of options i had, i looked deeper into working of
Linux and i found that it doesn't matter which distro you have. You can make
each distro into anything you want, it is in general still Linux. Distro only
adds preinstalled features and make the setup simpler.  
And after few hours of searching and comparing i came to Arch.

#### Arch
Distro which is by a big community considered as the ultimate Linux. It is
lightweight, it has a big documentation and also a lot of packages.  
The only downside for new user is the not automatic installation. You need to
boot the disk into live environment and from there only with comand line and you
external mobile phone, you need to install the system.

#### WSL
For a Linux i had one more option and it was using WSL. It is Windows Subsystem
for Linux. It has it's benefits, like it runs beneath the hood of Windows, it
has access to Windows file system and also to Linux one. But it didn't fixed my
problem with BsoD, because for running the WSL, you need to use the Windows.

## Installing the Arch
When i chosed my new operating system i was having 2 disks in my laptop and i
wasn't using one of them, so i had the process easier.

### Minimum requirements
You need RAM of at least 512 MB and storage of size at least 2GB
