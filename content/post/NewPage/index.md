# This is just ReadMe file.
If you had read some documentation to some project. There is really high chance that you read some ReadMe file. Thank you again that you opened this blog and also I want to thank Erika. She is one of the best person which you can met. Maybe if she wants to add some info about her here, maybe she will do it.

But for now, I want to thank her that she in her own time wants to help me, with this blog so you can have better experience with reading it without grammatic mistakes.

Thank you. ‚ù§
